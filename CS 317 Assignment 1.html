<h2>Special Note</h2> All assignments in this course must compile and
run on the Linux undergrad servers provided for student use. If you
use a different environment be sure to check that your solution works
on the ugrad machines as you will be graded on how it works on the
department machines not on your own machine. All instructions for
accessing code, building programs, using source code control tools
etc, assume you are working on these machines. If you are working in a
different environment commands and parameters may be different. Given
the diverse collection of machines it is not possible for us to
provide instruction and guidance on how to use these tools or their
analogues across these varied environments.  <B>Pleas for leniency or
special consideration of the nature "But it works on my laptop under
...." will not be entertained,</b> so make sure it works on the
undergraduate Linux servers and allow time for testing in that environment so
that you are confident your code works as expected there. Running
code on different machines and environments is a good way to find bugs.



    <h2>Assignment Overview</h2>

    <p>
    In this assignment you will use the Java socket related classes to
    create an FTP client. Your program is to provide some basic FTP
    client functionality through a simple text-based
    interface. Only a subset of the FTP commands are to be
    implemented.
    
    <p>
    Your program will provide a simple command line interface to the
    user. The program will read a command  typed by the user, and
    then interpret the command  according to the command descriptions  given
    below. Once the program has finished processing the command it will wait for another user command. 
    Whenever the program is awaiting user input it is to print the text
    '<tt>csftp&gt; </tt>' (Note the blank character after the &gt;). It is to leave the
    cursor at that position awaiting input. (i.e., the program is not to print
    '<tt>csftp&gt;</tt>' on a line by itself.  You may assume that command
    lines do not have more than 255 characters. 
    Empty lines and lines starting with the
    character '<tt>#</tt>' are to be <b>silently</b> ignored, and a new prompt
    displayed. 
    <p>
      The program is to take two command line arguments, the first is
    the FQDN or IP address of a host to connect to and the second is
    the port number to contact on the server. The port number is
    optional. If the port number is not supplied the program is to use
    port 21. If there are insufficient command line arguments then the
    program is to print a message and exit. The message provided in
    the starter code is sufficient. Assuming your program connects to
    the ftp server, the server will immediately send a response of
    either 120, 220, or 421. Upon receipt and processing of the
    response your program is to go into the above described command
    prompt mode. According to section 5.4 of the FTP RFC the
    communication between the client and server is an alternating
    dialogue. As a result your program can send a command and then
    wait for a response.  There is no need to develop a multihreaded
    client.
      
  <p>If the connection fails, or is rejected, the program is to print the 0xFFFC error message. If the initial response from the server is incomplete, that is there is an I/O error  then error 0xFFFD is printed.
    
   <p>
    The following table describes the  commands from the user that your program is to 
accept and a brief summary to  implement and
    identifies the FTP messages sent over the command channel to the FTP server.
    
    <table border=1 cellspacing=0>
    <tr><th>Application Command</th><th>Description</th><th>FTP&nbsp;command&nbsp;to&nbsp;server</th></tr>
    
    
    <tr><td>user&nbsp;USERNAME</td><td>Sends the username to the FTP
    server. The user will need to pay attention to the response code to determine if the 
    password command must be sent. 
     This is, typically, the first command the user will enter.</td><td>USER, PASS</td></tr>

based on the response will prompt for user name and password and send the user name. if no password is needed then discard otherwise use.

    A command line is composed of a command, as described above,
    followed by zero or more parameters. The command is separated from any
    parameters 
    by one or more
    spaces and/or tabs. Tabs or spaces at the end of the line are to be
    ignored. Your FTP client may detect certain types of errors. When an error
    is detected the client is to print a single line consisting of the specified hex  number and a short text message. In the list below, the
    message to print is in bold and it is followed by a description of the
    error it corresponds to, and if appropriate it describes how to
    proceed.  Note that the client is only to exit when it gets the 
    <b>quit</b> command or encounters one of the errors below that requires the client to
    quit.

<ul>
  <li><b>0x001 Invalid command.</b>  This is printed when the command entered by
    the user is not one of the accepted commands. 
  <li><b>0x002 Incorrect number of arguments.</b> This is printed when the command
    is valid but the wrong number of arguments is provided. Note this could be
    the case if there are either too many or too few arguments.
<!--
  <li><b>902 Invalid argument.</b> This is printed when the command is valid, and
    has the proper number of arguments, but one or more the arguments are
    invalid.
  <li><b>903 Supplied command not expected at this time.</b> This is printed
    when the command is valid, but not allowed at this time. For example, when
    the client first starts the only command to accept at that point is
    <b>open</b>. If it gets any other known command it would print this
    message. Note that the printing of this message takes priority over error
    messages 901 and 902. (i.e., even if errors 901 or 902 occur this message is
    the only one to print.)
-->
  <li><b> 0x38E Access to local file XXX denied.</b> In the message XXX is the
    file name of the local file that cannot be accessed. When performing a <b>get</b>
    it is possible that the client will not be allowed to create or write the
    named file.
 Observe that a get     error on the remote side will result in response codes from the server
    indicating a problem and they will, through the normal course of
    processing by the client, be printed, so there is no need to print any
    additional information in that situation.
  <li><b>0xFFFC Control connection to xxx on port yyy failed to open.</b>  When an attempt to establish the connection can't be
    completed within 20 seconds, or the socket cannot be
    created, then print this message,
    replacing xxx and yyy with the hostname, in the format on provided on the command line,  and port number, in decimal,  of the target ftp
    server you are trying to establish the control
    connection to. After printing the message the program is to exit.
  <li><b>0xFFFD Control connection I/O error, closing control connection.</b>If at any point an error while
    attempting to read from, or write to, the open control connection occurs, this
    message is to printed, and the socket closed/destroyed. The client is then
    to exit.
  <li><b>0x3A2 Data transfer connection to xxx on port yyy failed to open.</b>
    This message is to be
    printed when a data connection cannot be established within 10 seconds or the socket cannot be created.  The xxx and yyy are to be replaced with the hostname, in the format provided on the command
    line, 
    and port number, in decimal,  of the target ftp server respectively.
  <li><b>0x3A7 Data transfer connection I/O error, closing data connection.</b>
If at any point an error while
    attempting to read (or write, but that should never be the case) from the
    open data transfer connection occurs, this
    message is to printed, and the data transfer socket closed/destroyed. The client is then
    to go back to accepting commands. Note that this error does not trigger the
    closing of the command connection.
  <li><b>0xFFFE Input error while reading commands, terminating.</b> This error
    message is printed if an exception is thrown while the client is reading
    its commands (i.e., standard input). After printing this message the client
    will terminate.
  
 <li><b>0xFFFF Processing error. yyyy.</b> If for some reason you detect an error
   that isn't described above, print this message and replace yyyy with some
   appropriate text that briefly describes the error and exit 
</ul> 
    <p>
    Your program will be run at the command line by doing <tt>java -jar
        CSftp.jar </tt>. (The supplied Makefile will also run the command if
    you enter <tt>make run</tt>)
 
    <p>
    All messages sent by the client to the FTP server over the control connection  must be echoed 
    to  standard output with the prefix '<tt>--&gt&nbsp;</tt>' (Note the space
                                after the --&gt). All messages received on the 
                                control connection by the client program must be printed
    with the prefix '<tt>&lt--&nbsp;</tt>' (Note the space after the &lt--). Except for
    the text described above, no other text is to be printed by your
    program unless it is part of what the ftp client does or is listed as an
    error message your program is supposed to print. 
    
    <p>
    To get started read  <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc959.txt">RFC 959</a> to
    understand the nature of the messages exchanged between the client
    and server.  (If you have access to the 6th edition section 2.3 of that
    edition also has an overview of FTP that might be helpful.) This site, 
   <a href="http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/Internet/node119.html" target="_blank">
http://www.cs.cf.ac.uk/Dave/Internet/node119.html</a>, does a pretty good job of 
interpreting the ftp protocol and providing examples and explanations about what needs to be done. 

<p>Remember, You are only required to implement a subset of the protocol so some of the material in the references goes beyond what you need.
Keep in mind that the RFC
    describes the data (protocol) exchanges between the ftp client
    (i.e., what you are writing) and an ftp server. It does not
    describe the commands typed by the user and accepted by the ftp client program, those are
  described in the table above.




    <h2>Implementation Constraints and Suggestions</h2>

    <p>
    If you don't know how any of the ftp client commands above are supposed to
    work, check the 'ftp' command available on the department Linux servers. This
    program has all the commands you are required to implement. The -d command line option might be helpful in understanding what messages are exchanged between the client and server. Use some caution when interpreting the output with the -d option as the client issues a number of commands to the server that you do not have to implement. Some of 
these commands help optimize the interaction between the client and server but do not affect functionality. Just
    like the ftp client program  on the lab machines, when your program starts
    it makes the connection prints the response from the server before
    printing the command prompt. 
    
    <p>
    Don't spend too much time in the implementation of the shell. A
    simple show prompt, read line, identify command, run command is
    sufficient.
    
    <p>
    You aren't expected to implement any command that is not
    listed, but you can if you want. 
    
    

    <p>
    Don't try to implement this assignment all at once. Instead
    incrementally build and simultaneously test the solution. A suggested strategy is to:
    
    <ul>
      <li>Read RFC to understand how the protocol works. Roughly the program works as follows
      <ul>
	<li>Establish a connection to a server
        <li>Send a user name 
        <li>Transfer a file 
      </ul>
      <li>Create a simple prompt, accept and
      parse simple commands but don't act on them
      <li>Read the arguments and create the connection based on the
      arguments;
      <li>Implement commands that do not require a data connection,
      like user, cd and quit;
      <li>Implement the get, and dir commands in passive mode;
    </ul>
    
    <p>
    Regarding the establishment of the data connection, your FTP client is
    to support passive mode only and it is to request that files transferred by
    the RETR ftp protocol command are to be in binary. Do not assume that
    the server will default to binary. It is okay to use binary mode for all transfers, including those used for the directory listing. In passive mode, before transferring a
    file, the client sends the PASV message and waits for a response. The
    response includes the port number the client is to establish a data
    connection on. Once the client establishes the data connection the file is
    transferred. If  the ftp client tries to make a data connection to the
    server and the socket can't be created or a connection isn't established within a 
    10 seconds then the attempt to establish the
    connection should be abandoned, sockets etc closed/destroyed, and the 0x3A2
    message printed. 
    
    <p>
    For testing purposes you can connect to any FTP server, like
    ftp.cs.ubc.ca or ftp.debian.org (both accept the user 'anonymous'
    and any password). On some machines, but not our department machines, 
    you might be able to run a server by issuing the command 
       'ftpd -p XXXX' where XXXX is a
    random port number greater than 1024 that you have selected. If supported, the command will start a new FTP server at the
    specified port. The login for this server is your account name and
    password, and the root directory is your home directory. Keep in mind
    that the password is sent in plain text and is not encrypted so if you 
    connect to this ftp server over a network someone could sniff your
    password.  (The department does have vsftpd that you can run, if you can
    figure it out.) 
    
Constantly typing in the ftp commands for your client can become a bit tedious
    after awhile. To reduce your typing you might want to checkout the
    command autoexpect on the cs machines. It basically lets you issue a
    series of commands, record the output and then play the commands back. You
    would start by doing:
<pre>
autoexpect java -jar CSftp.jar ftp.cs.ubc.ca 21
</pre>

In the folder where CSftp.jar lives. You can then type in the sequence of
commands that you wish to test and quit at the end. Once you're done autoexpect
will generate a script.exp file that you can run by doing 
<pre>
./script.exp 
</pre>
You can also edit the script.exp file to be more generous with respect to the expected responses.


    <p>
    You may discuss this assignment with your classmates, but you must
    do your work only with your  partner. You are not allowed to
    show your code, even for discussion or explanatory purposes to
    other classmates.
    
    <p>
    Your code is to be developed for the Undergrad Linux server machines
    (e.g., remote.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca). The TAs will test your code on these machines, so
    test your program extensively in this environment, <em>including
    your Makefile</em>.
    
    <p>
    Style and comments are part of the evaluation, so keep your code
    clear, clean and well-documented. See the section on marking criteria
    in the assignment description on what we will be looking for. 
    
    
    <h2>What to Hand In</h2>

    <p>
     You are to use git to handin all materials for this assignment. The last
     push of the <b>master</b> branch of your repo is what will be marked. Any late penalty will be
     computed based on the time of your last push.  Any commits pushed after
     the
48-hour deadline for late submissions will be ignored. A 15% penalty will be 
applied if we are asked to mark any branch other than the master branch. It is highly recommend that you clone your final submission and retest it to make sure you haven't forgot to commit something. 
    
    <p>
    Make sure your git repository on the department stash server has the following files: 
    <ul>
      <li>A <em>README.txt</em> file that contains any information you would 
      like to convey to the TAs about your assignment. For example maybe you
      didn't get some part of the assignment working, or it works in some 
      circumstances but not others. If you have no comments you can leave the 
      file empty or remove it from your repository. The contents of the file
        must
      be plain text ASCII that is easily viewable using more on the ugrad Linux
        machines. As such limit your lines to 90 characters. If you are using Windows
        make sure that the the format makes sense on the Linux machines. 

      <li>All of the java files required to build your version of  CSftp.jar. Don't forget to use the git add command to include any new or update files to the list of files to commit and then push.  
      <li>A Makefile such that when the TA types <tt>make</tt> a
      binary file named <tt>CSftp.jar</tt> is built. The jar file  must end
      up in the same directory as the Makefile is (i.e., the home
      directory of your assignment). Note, this does not have to be a
      complicated Makefile and it is acceptable for the Makefile to
      always rebuild the program regardless of whether or not they are
      out-of-date with respect to their source files. We have supplied you with a Makefile that should provide this basic functionality, <b>don't break it!<b>
    </ul>
